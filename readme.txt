**Synopsis**
Sign Language is the dominant form of communication language used in the deaf and hearing-impaired community. 
To make an easy and mutual communication between the hearing-impaired and the hearing communities, building a robust
system capable of translating the spoken language into sign language is fundamental. To this end, sign language  recognition
are necessary parts for making such a system.
Sign Language Translator is a user-friendly and robust system. Not everyone knows how to interpret a sign language when 
having a conversation with a deaf and dumb person. There is always a need to communicate using sign language. One finds 
it hard to communicate without an interpreter. To solve this we need a product that is versatile and robust. We need to convert 
the sign language so that it is understood by common people and will help them to communicate without any barriers. The main 
purpose of this project is to eliminate the barrier between the deaf and dumb and the rest. So how do you translate sign language?
 With a camera of course and a bit of ML magic.

***Modules***
(i)Train
       Allows the user to train the respective sign so that model automatically detects the sign with corresponding sign name.
(ii)Test
       Gives a real time testing environment where it allows the user to test the signs.
(iii)Check Sign
       Allows the user to see all the available signs trained in the model.
